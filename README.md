### Telegram powered AI medical assistant. 
The point of this project was to explore programming beyond algorithmic LeetCode problems and Jupyter Data Science. This goal was achieved. Keywords and topics that have became meaningful to me: GitHub, Server set-up, Bash, CI/CD Workflow, Assynchronous programming, API. Now, the practical result is the so-called medical assistant made to collect pre-appointment symptom info and help you organize medical data. Try it via https://t.me/beta_health_bot
