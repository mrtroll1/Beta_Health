### Telegram powered AI medical assistant. 
The point of this project was to explore coding beyond my knowledge at the time (algorithmic LeetCode problems and JupyterNotebook Data Science). This goal was achieved:) Keywords and topics that have became meaningful to me: Git, Command line, Server set-up, API. Now, the practical result is the so-called medical assistant made to collect pre-appointment symptom info and help you organize medical data. Try it via https://t.me/beta_health_bot

The code is poorly structured (and there are no tests!) - very unprofessional:) I decided to keep it that way for authenticity.
